# Beautiful Number
Beautiful Number You are given two sets of non-zero digits.

In decimal notation, we call a positive integer beautiful if it contains at least one digit from each of these sets.

Find the smallest beautiful number.

Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 9) - the sizes of the first and second sets. The second line contains n different digits d1, d2, ..., dn. The third line contains m distinct digits r1, r2, ..., rm (1 ≤ di, ri ≤ 9).

Output Output the smallest beautiful number.

Example In the example there are such beautiful numbers as 13, 18, 3451 and so on. The smallest of them is 13.

The time limit is 1 second. The memory usage limit is 128 MiB.
